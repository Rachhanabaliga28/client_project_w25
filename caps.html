            <p>University Health & Counseling (UHC) supports the health and well-being of the campus community. We are
                inspired to help students realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, work productively,
                and connect meaningfully with others.

                UHC is made up of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which offers counseling services, and
                University Health Service (UHS), which offers medical services.<strong> This website is about

            <h2>What is CAPS?</h2>
            <p>CAPS is committed to creating an environment based on the values of multicultural, multi-disciplinary and
                multi-theoretical practices that allow our diverse student body to access care, receive high quality
                services and take positive pathways to mental health.
                We offer both in-person and virtual services.</p>
            <p>Our Front Desk (Michigan Union 4th Floor) is open and ready to help support you -- staff members are
                available throughout the day to assist you with your needs to answer questions, and get you to the right
                place. We can be reached by phone at: (734) 764-8312.</p>
            <p>CAPS has a limited number of <a href="https://caps.umich.edu/article/private-counseling-rooms">private
                    spaces</a> available for students to connect with their counselor via telecounseling. Please contact
                the front desk for more information on those private spaces.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://caps.umich.edu/lets-talk">Let's Talk</a></h3>
                    <p>Is a free program that supports students starting their mental health journeys. It provides
                        casual meetings with counselors during specific drop-in times for initial support and advice.</p>
                    <p>Trained mental health counselors are now available for drop-in conversations at different times
                        and locations across campus, including at Trotter, the Spectrum Center, South Quad, the
                        International Center, and Bursley.</p>
                    <p>This informal, confidential “office hours” style can be a great fit for students unsure about
                        formal counseling; for those with a specific, time-limited concern they’d like to talk through;
                        or those seeking information on campus resources.
                        Please note: this is not meant for crisis or emergency support.</p>

                        <p>Individual Peer Counseling (IPC) is designed to offer a new way to meet the needs of students
                            across the University of Michigan. We are here to support student mental health and offer
                            students a place to vent.</p>
                        <p>Peer counselors are trained in active listening by professional staff
                            here at CAPS. The IPC program connects students with someone of a similar age, interest and
                            background who can serve as a resource or simply someone to “rant” to. </p>
                        <p>While Peer Counselors
                            will keep all information private, IPC is not a substitute for confidential therapy provided by
                            a licensed mental health CAPS staff member.</p>

                    <p>Uwill provides students with access to a therapist of their choice via the mode of their choice -
                        video, phone, chat or messaging. Teletherapy services are available during the day, as well as
                        evenings, weekends, and holidays. Uwill has licensed mental health professionals available in

                    <p>This service has been successfully used by other counseling centers, including in the Big 10.</p>
                    <p>Uwill is an addition to CAPS services that provides students with video, phone, chat, and message
                        sessions with licensed mental health professionals at no cost. This additional counseling option
                        offers students greater flexibility and allows CAPS to expand its service capacity.</p>
